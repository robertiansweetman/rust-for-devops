# rust-for-devops

Having (currently) zero experience with Rust I wanted to understand how useful it is in this domain. Although it really does feel like Rust is becoming a 'thing' it may be unsuitable for DevOps. I'd like to try to find out.

There are no guarantees about how often this repo will be updated, given that I am learning a whole list of other topics concurrently nut let's give it a go.
