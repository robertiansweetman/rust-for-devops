* Rust is centered around traits and safe access to data
* Don't try to eat the whole elephant at once - focus on structs, vectors, iteration, result and option
* Work with examples that provide immediate feedback
* Start small

* Don't expect to learn it all
* Try to be realistic with the amount of new things you can learn at any one time
* To learn Rust you need to learn more than Rust
 * Are you motivated/self-interested?
* Deliberate regular practice is the best way to improve
* Find people that you trust to ask questions of
* Share things you learn as you learn them
* Give yourself permission to fail and forgive yourself for your mistakes
* You're allowed to use inefficient methods like .clone() and .to_string() to get things working
* There is a lot of time to learn idiomatic Rust later
* You have permission to have difficulty understanding things like borrowing, ownership, lifetimes, references, smart pointers and _ etc.
* When you are ready read more complicated rust code
* There's more than one way to achieve a specific outcome
